**Project README: Statistical Analysis of World Countries Dataset**

### Overview:

This project, undertaken as part of the Statistics for Computer Science course, involves a comprehensive statistical analysis of a dataset pertaining to global countries. The dataset encompasses information on countries, their respective capitals, and key parameters such as birth rate, literacy rate, agricultural land (%), among others.

### Dataset Description:

The dataset is structured to include information on various attributes related to world countries, providing a rich foundation for statistical exploration. Key attributes include birth rate, literacy rate, agricultural land percentage, and more.

### Statistical Analysis Methods:

The following statistical analysis methods were employed to rigorously examine the dataset:

1. **One Sample Z-Test:**
   - Assessing statistical significance of a sample mean against a known population mean.

2. **One Sample t-Test:**
   - Determining if the mean of a single sample is significantly different from a known or hypothesized population mean.

3. **Variations of Above Tests:**
   - Exploring different adaptations and variations of one-sample Z and t-tests.

4. **Runs Test:**
   - Examining the occurrence of runs (consecutive data points of the same type) in the dataset.

5. **Sign Test:**
   - Assessing the difference in medians between two related groups.

6. **Wilcoxon Rank Sum Test:**
   - Comparing two independent samples to assess if they are from the same distribution.

7. **Wilcoxon Signed Rank Test:**
   - Determining if there is a significant difference between paired samples.

8. **Variations of Above Tests:**
   - Exploring additional adaptations and variations of the above tests.

9. **Goodness of Fit:**
   - Evaluating how well the observed distribution fits an expected distribution.

10. **Test for Independence:**
    - Assessing the independence between two categorical variables.

11. **Testing Proportions for Homogeneity using Chi-Squared Method:**
    - Examining homogeneity of proportions using the chi-squared method.

12. **Chi-Squared Contingency Table Test:**
    - Evaluating the association between two categorical variables in a contingency table.

13. **Other Variations of the Tests:**
    - Exploring further adaptations and modifications of the aforementioned statistical tests.

14. **Calculation of Sample Size:**
    - Determining the required sample size to achieve a desired level of precision for specific attribute values.

### Conclusion:

This project provides a comprehensive exploration of statistical methods, testing the independence and relationships within the world countries dataset. The analyses offer valuable insights into the distribution and interdependence of various attributes, contributing to a deeper understanding of the dataset's characteristics.
